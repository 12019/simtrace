SIMTRACE is a program that can be used for tracing the communication
betewen a phone and the SIM card.  More generally, it can trace any
ISO 7816 based smart card interface.

This repository contains a host program 'simtrace' as well as a patch
for wireshark.

The corresponding device firmware can be found in the openpcd.git
repository on git.gnumonks.org.
