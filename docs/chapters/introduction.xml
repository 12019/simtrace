        <para>SIMtrace was created out of necessity. Harald Welte wanted
        to see the communication between a GSM Mobile Station (or
        what we call a cellphone) and the SIM. He was not able to
        find an existing solution, or the existing ones had mayor
        drawbacks that made using them very time consuming and slow.
        The Atmel AT91SAM7 came to the rescue. This microcontroller
        has hardware support for the  ISO7816 T0/T1 Smart Card
        specification. We can connect the external clock to the UART
        and are able to read bytes coming and going to the SIM.
        The next step in the project was taken by Kevin Redon
        that started to modify an existing AT91SAM7 design, started
        to use the Free Software KiCAD CAD Software. In 2011 the project
        went from having Schematics to having routed circuits, prototypes
        and the final product. The first production run was in August.</para>

        <para>The setup of SIMtrace consists out of a Hardware and a
        Software part. The SIM card needs to be put into the SIMtrace
        Hardware, the flex cable needs to be connected to the SIMtrace
        Hardware and the SIM end needs to be placed in the SIM socket
        of the phone. The SIMtrace hardware can be seen as a USB device
        from the host, the SIMtrace software will try to find this device
        and claim it. The SIMtrace software will receive packets from the
        SIMtrace hardware and can forward them using the GSMTAP protocol
        to the IANA assigned GSMTAP port (4729). A modified version of Wireshark
        can be used to analyze the data.</para>
